# 🎯 Mini Project (Day 10 Task) – Age Category Assignment

## 📌 Description
This project is a Python script (`age_category.py`) that assigns an **age category** based on user input.  
The program asks the user to enter their **name** and **age**, then determines which category they belong to.  

Age categories:
- **Child** → 0–12  
- **Teen** → 13–19  
- **Adult** → 20–59  
- **Senior** → 60+  
## 📂 Files
- `age_category.py` → The main Python script  
- `README.md` → Documentation file (this file)
## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open your terminal.  
2. Run the script with Python:

```bash
python3 age_category.py

## So, what does the f do in this python program?

## It tells Python:
“This string may contain variables or expressions inside { } that should be evaluated and replaced with their values.”

✅ In short:
The f makes a string dynamic, allowing variables and expressions inside { } to be replaced with real values.
# here’s what happens:
Variables store information
name holds the word "Sinai".
age holds the number 16 (or any number you provide).
The f before the string

Tells Python: “Look inside the curly braces { } and replace them with the actual values of those variables.”

The print statement
Combines the text "Hello ... you are ... years old." with the variable values.

# Final message becomes:
For example, it will display:
Hello Sinai, you are 16 years old.
 Without the f, it would just print {name} and {age} as plain text, not their values.

✅ So the purpose is:
To mix variables with normal text and make the output look like a real sentence instead of separate pieces.
